# Center for Vital Longevity 2017 MATLAB Programming Bootcamp

## Overview
Computer programming skills are becoming an essential tool to conduct, and aid reproducibility of, 
research in psychology and neuroscience. The purpose of this 7-week bootcamp is to introduce computer 
programming using the Matlab(R) programming environment. This bootcamp will comprise a mixture of 
lectures and “hands-on” programming, and individual work between sessions. 

## Learning Outcomes
After completion of this bootcamp, you will hopefully have a solid foundation of the following 
concepts: variables, data structures, selection/loop statements, vectorization, object oriented 
programming (OOP), writing user-defined functions, basic statistical/plotting operations, and 
optimization functions (time and interest permitting).These concepts are common in many other 
programming languages used in our fields, such as R and Python. In addition, you will gain experience
with using GitHub to keep track of changes in your code as well as share your code with others.

## Meeting Day and Time
Meeting will begin the week of September 21, 2017. 
Exact day and time still TBD.

## Outline
* Week 1 - Variable Types and Data Structures/Introduction to Github
* Week 2 - Data Structures and Introduction to Object Oriented Programming
* Week 3 - Selection Statements
* Week 4 - User-Defined Functions
* Week 5 - Plotting
* Week 6 - Statistics/Machine Learning
* Week 7 - TBD

## Course Materials
1. Laptop with Matlab 2016a or newer
2. A free GitHub account
3. (Suggested, but not necessary) Attaway, S. (2017). MATLAB: A practical introduction to programming 
and problem solving (4th edition). 

## Disclaimer
Participation is completely voluntary. This bootcamp does NOT provide any course credits (specific to 
graduate students) or any certificates. 

## Expectations
Although this is voluntary, the expectation is that those interested in learning how to program will 
attend and participate in the weekly sessions and complete any practice work (if necessary) between 
meetings. The best way to learn how to program is to spend time programming, and any “assignments” 
(which are not graded) will be aimed at practicing how to program.
